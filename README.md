# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains various Python scripts and examples that I have written for **learning and practice purposes**.  
It is **not a production-level project** but a collection of exercises to improve Python programming skills.

---

## Contents

- **Basics**: Variables, operators, input/output, and simple math operations.
- **Control Flow**: `if-else` statements, loops (`for` & `while`), and logical operations.
- **Functions**: Defining functions, function arguments, return values, recursion, decorators, and lambda functions.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, comprehensions, and related operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, class & static methods, abstract classes, and operator overloading.
- **Advanced Python Concepts**: Exception handling, file handling, property decorators, map/filter functions, and pattern printing.
- **Number & String Challenges**: Palindrome check, prime numbers, factorial, strong numbers, perfect numbers, and more.

## Usage

- This code is meant for **learning and practice**.
- You can **run each script individually** to see how different Python concepts work.
- Experiment by **modifying values or functions** to reinforce your understanding.

## Notes

- The code is **structured for personal learning**, so it may not follow project-level architecture.
- Some scripts demonstrate **concepts multiple ways** for better understanding.
